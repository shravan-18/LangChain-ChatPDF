An application I developed using Langchain that allows users to engage with a PDF as though they're having a conversation with it..

This repository houses a project I created using the LangChain framework. It provides the capability to upload a PDF document and allows you to engage in a chat-like interaction with the LangChain framework as if you were conversing directly with the content of the PDF.
